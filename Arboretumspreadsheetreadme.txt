1. Label row
The first row in the spreadsheet is frozen in place and should always remain the first row. The labels in the first row are what is used by the application to locate data for all the trees benches and bricks. These label names should not be changed or else the data will not be read properly by the application.


2. Coordinates
        Only numbers should be input for latitude and longitude, the spreadsheet is set up to only take numbers within a certain range


3. Order of columns
        The order of columns does not matter except for the first column. The application is not set up to read any data from the first column so data that the application tries to read should not be put in the first column. The first column right now is set up to be the number of the object, which is not read into the application.
